# Employee Tracker - SQL & Inquirer (Module 12 Challenge)

## Description

This app is a simple, yet effective content management system (CMS) that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with employee information stored in an SQL database.  

This CMS uses `MySQL2` and `Inquirer` to prompt users with tasks relating to their employee database, and return easy-to-understand tables with the corresponding results.
